      <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
      <p>
        We are more than a team â€” we are a movement. A collective of dreamers, doers, and digital farmers united by a
        single belief: <strong>technology should empower, not exclude</strong>. At AgriGuru, engineers sit beside environmentalists,
        designers brainstorm with farmers, and coders write not just code â€” but change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of us grew up watching the monsoons decide our harvests. Others spent years coding algorithms in buzzing tech
        labs. But what binds us together is our shared purpose â€” to transform agriculture into a field of opportunity
        through AI, data, and empathy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our journey isn't confined to offices or whiteboards. We've stood in the heat of farmlands, spoken to elders who
        still rely on lunar calendars, and listened to youth who dream of farming with drones. <strong>AgriGuru was born from
        those voices</strong>, shaped by those soils, and built for those heroes â€” the farmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join us on this journey to empower farmers with the knowledge and tools they need to thrive in an ever-changing
        world. Together, we can cultivate a future where every farmer has the resources to succeed.

      <h2>Why AgriGuru?</h2>
      <p>
        Agriculture is the backbone of our nation â€” yet millions of farmers struggle with uncertainty: What crop should I
        plant? Will it rain next week? What price will I get in the market? These are real problems that need real-time,
        localized answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        AgriGuru steps in as an intelligent assistant built for every farmer â€” from seed to sale. Using open data,
        satellite intelligence, and AI-powered models, our platform delivers smart recommendations, weather alerts, and
        market trends in a user-friendly format.
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes us different? We donâ€™t just show data â€” we translate it into decisions. We donâ€™t need fancy sensors or
        IoT â€” just a phone and intent to grow better. AgriGuru is not just an app. It's a farming revolution in your
        pocket.
